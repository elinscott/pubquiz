   The format:
   \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
      \item five regular rounds
      \begin{itemize}
         \item eight questions each, which we will go through together
         \item questions within each round are linked by some common thread
      \end{itemize}
      \item picture and puzzle rounds
      \begin{itemize}
         \item for you to complete in your spare time
         \item puzzles require some explanation... examples to follow
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

   \onslide<8->{The etiquette:}
   \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]

      \item at the end of each round I can repeat previous questions upon request, so don't worry if you've forgotten what a previous question was
      \item the quizmaster is \emph{always} right
   \end{itemize}
